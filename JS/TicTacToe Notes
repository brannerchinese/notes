# JavaScript Notes for TicTacToe Game

Working on adding "medium" and "hard intelligence" levels for [my TicTacToe Game] (https://github.com/marniehogue/projects/blob/master/TicTacToe_AI_Round%202)

Here’s my basic outline – player goes first or computer goes first depending on chance.
-Player Goes
-Computer Goes
	If level = “easy” 
Then random move 
	If level = “medium”
		checks if can make winning move or blocking move
		if not, then random move
	If level = “hard” (still need to add this code)
If computer goes first, the computer’s first move is placed strategically 
(in either the center or corners)
		If computer goes second, computer places a move based on player’s first move
			(still need to figure out this part)
		In all remaining moves, computer checks for winning move or blocking move
		If not, then random move
